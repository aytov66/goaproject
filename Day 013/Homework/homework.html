  <!-- 
  1.HTML is what we use to build websites.
  It tells the browser what to show — like text, images, buttons, etc.
  -->

  <!-- 
  2. Empty tag vs Container tag

  Empty tag = a tag that doesn’t need a closing tag.
  Example: <img>

  Container tag = a tag that can store content and has an opening and a closing tag.
  Example: <p>Some text</p>
  -->

  <!-- 
  3. Why use lowercase tags?

  It's not necessary but it's a good habit
  Most people write HTML in lowercase to keep things easy to read.

<body>

  <!-- 
  4) What these tags do:
  <head> = hidden stuff like the title and page info
  <body> = the main part people see
  <title> = shows the name in the browser tab
  <meta> = gives the browser extra info (like what language)
  <p> = paragraph, used for text
  <h1>-<h6> = headings (h1 is biggest, h6 is smallest)
  <button> = clickable button
  <img> = shows an image
  <table> = used to show info in rows and columns
